Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis:

## Exploring and Understanding Basic Data
Data Distribution:

Analyzed the distribution of data across different accounts to understand the sales patterns and client diversity.
Sales Difference by Account Type:

Client-Specific Strategies:

Analyzed the data by breaking down the impact of marketing strategies and competition based on account type, revealing that different client types respond differently to various strategies.
## Final Recommendations:
# Optimized Marketing Strategies:

* Based on the coefficient analysis, we identified the return on investment (ROI) for each dollar spent on different campaigns and sales contacts.
* Tailored recommendations for each account type were developed to maximize efficiency and reduce costs by focusing on the most effective strategies.
# Case Explanation - Medium Facility:

*For medium facilities, flyer campaigns show a significant ROI, with each dollar spent yielding an average return of $4.
* Sales Contact 2 is the most effective, followed by Sales Contact 1 and Sales Contact 3.
Other strategies that showed no impact can be eliminated to save costs.
By leveraging these insights, we can optimize marketing efforts to enhance sales performance and allocate resources more effectively based on client-specific needs.
